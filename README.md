Developer's Message

I’ve put effort into making this tool both practical and simple to use. I tried to focus on being simplistic and developing a clean, functional extension. This project represents my path to learning and improving as a developer. I’m looking forward to exploring more upgrades and enhancements in the future. 


Installation

1) Clone the repository:
2) Go to Chrome’s Extensions page: chrome://extensions
3) Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right corner).
4) Click Load unpacked and select the folder where you cloned the project.
5) The extension will now appear in your Chrome toolbar!


Future Enhancements

1) Add options for customizing PDF settings (e.g., margins, orientation).
2) Support for saving selected portions of web pages.
3) Develop features for web annotations, allowing users to highlight or comment directly on the page before generating the PDF.
4) Implement a dark mode for the extension interface.
5) Explore integrating cloud storage options to directly save PDFs to platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox.
